# What is webxdc?

A `.xdc` file is a locked-down peer-to-peer HTML5 app. It has not network access other than sending and receiving messages from other instances of the same app in the chat. Encryption and transport of app data is managed through a simple API provided by the chat messenger.

## What kind of interactive content can be created with this?
