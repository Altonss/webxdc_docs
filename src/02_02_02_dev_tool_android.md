# Developing on Android

TODO - turn notes into a nice guide

- install Termux
- install python & git in termux (or is it preinstalled??)
- git clone the devtool repo or your fork of it
- use `python -m http.server` (TODO check complete syntax) to serve it for development and use nano / vim
- when your done use the packaging script
- and then copy the file to a location from where you can access and send it via deltachat.

- pro tip: you can create symbolic link to a folder in the external storage
