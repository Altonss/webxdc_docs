<!-- this section is inpired by https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/ -->

In this chapter you can find small code snippets (recipes) that help you implement some commonly used features, such as scoreboards for adding a highscore to your game.

Feel free to contribute recipies that you find useful on [github](https://github.com/deltachat/webxdc_docs).

(As this section is being written, you might find more examples in the [core library](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/blob/master/draft/webxdc-dev-reference.md)).
