# Optimizing your Icon

There are several things you can do to shrink down the size of your icon:

- save without thumbnail image (in gimp it can be done in the export dialog)
- shrink the image resolution (`256px` are enough, in some cases `128px` or even lower like `64px` can sufice)
- change your PNG colors from `RGB` to `Indexed` (in gimp `Image` -> `Mode` -> `Indexed`, see <https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-image-convert-indexed.html>)
