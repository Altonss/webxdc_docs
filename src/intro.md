# Introduction 

Webxdc is a new way to develop, share and use web apps in messenger chat groups. Anyone can build html5 apps without permission and share it with friends by simply sending a message with an attached `.xdc` file as defined by [file format]. Once a webxdc app is shared in a chat, its members can click "start" to run the app and interact with each other through the app.

Webxdc apps can only send and receive messages in the chat by using the [Javascript API] provided by the messenger. Each Webxdc app thus gets automatic end-to-end encryption and peer discovery for free. 

Webxdc is specified through its [file format] and [Javascript API] for developing web apps, and through instructions on the [Messenger implementation] for running and sharing webxdc apps in chats. Webxdc is supported and evolving in conjunction with the [Delta Chat](https://delta.chat) e-mail messenger apps which, if in doubt, serves as the default reference. 

You can follow and participate in further developments in the [webxdc GitHub organization](https://github.com/webxdc) and are invited to ask questions and post suggestions in [the "webxdc" support forum](https://support.delta.chat/c/webxdc/20).
